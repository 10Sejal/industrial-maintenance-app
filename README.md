Project Title: Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction & Diagnostic System
Live App Link:https://industrial-maintenance-app-dhvfyoetago59v9arexadn.streamlit.app/

📌 Project Overview
This project was developed to address unplanned downtime in heavy industrial machinery—a critical challenge for engineering firms like Larsen & Toubro (L&T). Using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset, I built an end-to-end Machine Learning solution that predicts equipment failure before it occurs.

🚀 Key Features
Failure Prediction: Uses XGBoost to forecast mechanical breakdowns with a high Recall score, prioritizing site safety.

Machine Health Score: Converts complex probabilities into a simple 0-100% health gauge for site operators.

Maintenance Assistant: An integrated rule-based chatbot to provide instant technical tips for high-stress sensor readings.

Automated Reporting: Generates a professional PDF Diagnostic Report for documentation and maintenance ticketing.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, FPDF

Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud
